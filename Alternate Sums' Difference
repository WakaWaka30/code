/* Difference of the sum of alternate digits (D)
Given a positive integer 'x' (with even number of digits in it), write an algorithm and 
the subsequent code to compute the difference between  the sum of the digits occuring in 
the alternate positions (starting from the first position) and the sum of the digits occuring 
in the alternate positions,starting from the last rightmost position of 'x'

For example, consider the number  8975.  The sum of the digits that occur in the alternate positions 
from the first position is 8+7=15.  The sum of the digits that occur in the alternate positions, starting 
from the rightmost position is 5+9 = 14. Difference between the two sums is 1 (=15-14).  Similarly, for the 
number 5798, the difference between  two sums, is 1.*/  

/*Algorithm:
Step 1: start
Step 2: Create an integer function named counter, which counts the number of digits in a number n.
        Step 2.1 Declare count = 0 and a = n.
        Step 2.2 In an infinite loop, do count++ and a = a/10 until a<1 after which, break the loop.
        Step 2.3 Return count.
Step 3: Create an integer function alternateSumDiff for number n, which does the required task of the question.
        Step 3.1 Declare i = 0, a = n, sum1 = 0, sum2 = 0;
        Step 3.2 For i=0;i<counter(a);i++ if the value of i when divided by 2 gives 0 as the remainder then add 
                n%10 to sum1, else add n%10 to sum2.
        Step 3.3 Do n = n/10 for each iteration and if n<1, break the loop.
        Step 3.4 Return sum2-sum1
Step 4: Input n from user. If number of digits in n is odd, print error and return main to re-eneter values else 
        do alternateSumDiff(n) and print it as the result.
Step 5: End */
